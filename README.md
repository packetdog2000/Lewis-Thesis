### Detecting Patterns in Criminal Activities Using K-means and DBSCAN Clustering
Thesis For Data Science
MS Data Science by Edwin Garcia

This thesis describes the process of obtaining open data from the Harris County Crime Incidence Data and using K-Means and DBSCAN clustering methods to find patterns of crime. This involves extracting, cleaning and analyzing the dataset. The process also includes how to determine data features and properly load into statistical software package. The statistical package Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn is used in performing experiments to transform categorical features, and perform both K-Means and DBSCAN clustering. This thesis also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods and how it can be of use to crime practitioners and police departments.
